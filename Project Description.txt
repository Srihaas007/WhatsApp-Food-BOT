Project Name: WhatsApp Food Bot

Project Description:  we developed a friendly online food ordering chat bot using Python that works with the WhatsApp chatting system. Our goal was to create an efficient and easy-to-use bot that allows users to order food from nearby restaurants in a conversational way. The bot asks for the user's location and provides a list of restaurants that deliver to that location. Users can select a restaurant, choose their food items and toppings, and pay through various payment options. We used Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, and Discord for conversations during the project.

Project Features:
Automatic and manual location access for user convenience
List of nearby restaurants for food ordering
Option to choose food items and toppings
Multiple payment options for user convenience
